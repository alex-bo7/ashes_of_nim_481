## Excluded Files
Some files and directories (e.g., `.import/`, `.godot/`, `icon.png`, autogenerated configs) are excluded from this README as they are standard or self-explanatory within the Godot engine context.

**Overview of select excluded files:**  
- `.gd.uid`: A unique identifier used by Godot 4 to reliably track script files across the project, even if theyâ€™re moved or renamed.
- `.tscn`: A Godot scene file that defines the structure and properties of game objects. Scenes can be reused like templates and can include **nodes**, scripts, and settings.
    - **Node**: The basic building block in Godot. Each scene is made up of nodes (e.g., sprites, scripts, cameras), which are organized in a tree structure to define behavior and appearance.
- `.import`: Auto-generated by Godot to store optimized versions of imported assets (like models, textures, fonts).
